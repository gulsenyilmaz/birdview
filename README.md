# 🌐 BirdView

**BirdView** is an interactive data visualization project that maps artists (and other cultural figures) who were alive in a given year, based on museum collections, Wikidata, and extended metadata.

Inspired by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) collection and designed for extensibility, this project allows users to explore the lives of artists, thinkers, and other figures by time and geography.

## ✨ Features

- Visualizes artists and events on an **interactive flat world map** using **Deck.gl** and **MapLibre**  
- Time slider to select a year and dynamically update who was alive  
- Histogram-based year slider showing population distribution over time  
- Animated arcs show geographic distribution by year  
- Spiral layout prevents overlap when multiple artists share a nationality  
- Tooltips with artist name, age, or event details  
- War events and battles plotted with fading colors (red → purple → pale yellow, like a healing wound)  
- Filters by movement, museum, gender, or era
